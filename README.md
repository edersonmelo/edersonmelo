I am a Master's student in Education and I produce educational content on AI, Machine Learning, and Engineering, bringing a practical, accessible, and future-oriented approach. I believe that technology only transforms when it also educates and when it creates autonomy, not dependence.

I believe that the next phase of technology will be guided not only by algorithms, but by people capable of integrating intelligence, purpose, and execution. And that is where I build my work.
